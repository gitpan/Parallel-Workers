VERSION
    This document describes Parallel::Workers version *$VERSION*

SYNOPSIS
        use Parallel::Workers;
    
        #Workers that use Eval action with a trantransaction controller
        #                 ^^^^
    
        my $worker=Parallel::Workers->new(maxworkers=>4,timeout=>10, backend=>"Eval");

        my $id=$worker->create(hosts => \@named, command=>"`date`", 
                               transaction=>{error=>TRANSACTION_TERM, type=>'SCALAR',regex => qr/.+/m});
        my $info=$worker->info();
    
        #Workers that use SSH action with a trantransaction controller
        #                 ^^^
        $worker=Parallel::Workers->new(
                                        maxworkers=>16,timeout=>10, 
                                        backend=>"SSH", constructor =>{user=>'demo',pass=>'demo'}
                                      );

        $id=$worker->create(hosts => \@hosts, command=>"cat /proc/cmdline",
                                          transaction=>{error=>TRANSACTION_TERM, type=>'SCALAR',regex => qr/.+/m}); 

DESCRIPTION
    This *Parallel::Workers* allow you to run multiples tasks in parallel
    with an error validation.

    You can specify maxworkers value that limit the max physical threads.
    You can specify the backend that run the task, currently only Eval, SSH
    and XMLRPC are implemented, but you can make yours for your needs.

    Workers run simples tasks that return value. You can specify different
    way to check the return value and on error you decide to stop or
    continue the main workers.

            # workers TERM if return value is not in this regex /.+/m
            $id=$worker->create(...,
                                transaction=>{error=>TRANSACTION_TERM, type=>'SCALAR',regex => qr/.+/m }; 
        
            # workers TERM if return value is not 127
            $id=$worker->create(...,
                                transaction=>{error=>TRANSACTION_TERM, type=>'SCALAR',check => 127}; 

            # workers TERM if return value is not an HASH
            $id=$worker->create(...,
                                transaction=>{error=>TRANSACTION_TERM, type=>'ARRAY'}; 

            # workers CONTINUE on error
            $id=$worker->create(...,
                                transaction=>{error=>TRANSACTION_CONT, ...};
